# PassWord Generator 
## Description
What I made during this project was a random generator password. When clicking generate password button options are displayed on what the user would like to use in order to generate their password. I felt like I struggled way more than usual, so manay downs for this project, but I think what motivated me was the fact that I knew I would finish it eventually. Some of the problems that I came across while working on this project was being able to create a function that would actually generate the password, as well as having all off the if statements joinded togther. 

## Usage
The use of this project is to generate a random password for those looking for new password. The generator gathers random numbers together and spits something out that follows the users choosen guide lines. For instance, when first clicking generate password the prompt function is displayed and asks how many characters the user wants to pick 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
